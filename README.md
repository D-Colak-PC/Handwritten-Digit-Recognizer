# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

A small program to recognize digits written by the user in Python.
This project is meant for me to dip my toes into image recognition and as a learning tool for myself to learn the different aspects of making a digit recognizer.

This program uses Keras for neural networks and was trained on the MNIST database. The GUI is written in Tkinter for Python.
